### The Clique

#### E-commerce Site

The Clique is a personal practice project that showcases my skills in building a modern fashion e-commerce platform. Leveraging Next.js with TypeScript (.tsx), Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, I created a responsive and visually engaging user interface that enhances the shopping experience.

Technologies Used:
 * Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
 * Backend: Spring Boot, MySQL
 * Deployment: Google Cloud VM

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of full-stack development and explore the intricacies of e-commerce solutions. The Clique aims to provide users with a curated selection of trendy apparel and accessories while emphasizing smooth navigation and performance.
